        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am studying front end web development because i would like to become a full-time web developer. I have been using WordPress to design and build websites part time for a few years, but finally want to take the next step and learn how to build websites from scratch.</p>
        <h3>Hobbies &amp; Interests</h3>
        <p>In my spare time i enjoy spending time with my family, camping, surfing and snowboarding.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>After this techdegree course i plan to continue practicing and developing my skills in;</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>React</li>
          <li>Node.js</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To continue developing these skills i will keep working through online tutorials and trying to build my own projects. I am even considering taking the full-stack javascript course from Treehouse, as i am enjoying this one so far.</p>
        <p>My goal is to become proficient enough to start freelancing and getting paid work. As the workload increases and my skills continue to grow, i am hoping to one day take on web development full time.</p>
        <p>It has always been a dream of mine to be able to work remotely. I love the freedom of being able to work from anywhere, All i need is my MacBook, an internet connection and some good coffee!</p>
